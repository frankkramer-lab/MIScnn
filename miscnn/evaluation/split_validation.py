""" Function for an automatic Percentage-Split Validation of the Neural Network model by
    running the whole pipeline once with a test and train data set.

Args:
    sample_list (list of indices):          A list of sample indicies which will be used for validation.
    model (Neural Network model):           Instance of a Neural Network model class instance.
    percentage (float):                     Split percentage of how big the testing data set should be.
                                            By default, the percentage value is 0.2 -> 20% testing and 80% training
    epochs (integer):                       Number of epochs. A single epoch is defined as one iteration through the complete data set.
    iterations (integer):                   Number of iterations (batches) in a single epoch.
    evaluation_path (string):               Path to the evaluation data directory. This directory will be created and
                                            used for storing all kinds of evaluation results during the validation processes.
    draw_figures (boolean):                 Option if evaluation figures should be automatically plotted in the evaluation
                                            directory.
    run_detailed_evaluation (boolean):      Option if a detailed evaluation (additional prediction) should be performed.
    callbacks (list of Callback classes):   A list of Callback classes for custom evaluation.
    return_output (boolean):                Option, if computed evaluations will be output as the return of this function or
                                            if the evaluations will be saved on disk in the evaluation directory.
